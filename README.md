# Laptop_Price_Predictions
Machine_Learning_Algorithm_Used

-- The project seems to involve a Laptop Price Predictor where various features of laptops (such as company, type, screen size, CPU, RAM, GPU, operating system, weight, and price) were analyzed and used to predict --- prices. Based on this overview:

-- Developed a machine learning model to predict laptop prices based on features like company, CPU, RAM, GPU, and other hardware specifications.

-- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing on a dataset containing 1303 laptop entries with 12 features, ensuring data quality and consistency.

-- Implemented exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and relationships between laptop features and prices.

-- Used libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization to derive meaningful insights.

-- Optimized the model performance through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to improve price prediction accuracy.

-- Built a comprehensive end-to-end notebook to automate the analysis and model training process for future updates and scalability.
